#Summary of Functions and Nested loops with some notes.
- 0-putchar.c:
  Here I use a header file main.h to define a prototype for the class named
  0-putchar.c, in this main.h file, the prototype for _putchar is defined and
  then implemented in a class called _putchar.c where I just call the original
  putchar from stdio, essentially _putchar.c is just a wrapper around putchar()
